   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Features
- Signup / Login (localStorage)
- Profile dashboard (edit username/email)

- Product feed with search and category filter
- Cart & checkout (mocked; purchases saved to localStorage)
- Responsive UI with TailwindCSS
